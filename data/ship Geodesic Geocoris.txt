	description "This modified Geocoris has identical cargo capacity, but is modeled off one that was the result of an alien technology being merged with a hybrid Human-Hai operating system. It has additional shield emitters in a geodesic pattern over its main cargo wings, and a crucial element of the ship's system core is not manufactured, but grown from initial samples taken from the first occurrence. This means that some systems are built-in and unable to be removed, and also that it is substantially more expensive than its regular version. It is, however, significantly more survivable."

	description "This modified Geocoris has identical cargo capacity, but is the result of an alien technology being merged with a hybrid Human-Hai operating system. It has additional shield emitters in a geodesic pattern over its main cargo wings, and some kind of integrated system core which seems to have something of a life of its own. As such, some systems are built-in and unable to be removed. Nevertheless, it is significantly more survivable than a traditional Geocoris and at least as useful."
